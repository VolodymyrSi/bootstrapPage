### Bootstrap Responsive Page

[This website lives here](https://volodymyrsi.github.io/bootstrapPage)

In this little project, I used the powers of `bootstrap` to build a website which adapts to user's screen in three sizes - mobile, tablet and desktop. There are no `media` queries and there is almost no css since bootstrap `classes` take care of styling things. 

I used flexible column layout to display a set number of items per row based on the device *(more items on the desktop, fewer items on tablets and eventually move to column layout for mobile screens)*.

`Navbar` collapses into a `burger` menu on smaller screens.
